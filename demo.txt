What is your favorite movie?
	The Lord of the Rings
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
	New Zealand
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
	I would like to control luck. For instance I could choose to make myself or someone else especially lucky for a period of time,
	or if someone is bothering me I could make them unlucky. This condition should probably wear off over time,
	otherwise it would get a bit too messy.
